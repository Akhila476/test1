A Data subject rights (DSR) request occurs when an individual contacts IBM and requests IBM to act on a data right to which the data subject is entitled, for example, a request to access the Personal Information (PI) that IBM holds about him or her. A DSR request is not a catch-all for ‘Business As Usual’ (BAU) requests asking IBM to update or verify general business information such as name and contact information in IBM systems.  These are considered BAU requests, not DSR requests, and should be handled through IBM’s standard business processes.

A DSR request can be initiated by any individual with whom IBM has a relationship (e.g. current or former employee, job applicant, customer, or marketing contact). IBM Active employees DSR requests are typically directed back to Workday to view information but for separated employees, we may receive DSR requests.
